NOTICE:
It is recommended to use the official openFloor 
software repositories, located at http://github.com/vcazan/openFloor

USAGE INFO:
This package consist of two parts.

One piece of software, written in XCODE is responsible for tracking humans that are on the floor. It is located in the openCVBlobTracking folder. The project file is located at: openCVBlobTracking/apps/blobTracking/blobTracking-OSX/blobTracking.xcodeproj This program will spit out x,y coordinates as well as mood and the number of people on the floor. 

Here is a outline of this value:
Each message is made up of 6 numbers. 

First number:
0 = User has joined
1 = User has moved
2 = User has left the screen
3 = Mood Info
4 = User Blob Test (For testing)
99 = Scene Mood User

Second number: Order
Third number: ScaledX
Fourth number: ScaledY

The second piece of software is written with Processing. This application decodes the values from the tracking software and creates a user interface that can be projected on the floor. 


*NOTES*
-For more information on how to set up this installation just visit http://www.vladcazan.com/projects/openfloor/

-There is currently a BETA version of the flash interface. It is just a basic example on how to get the values from the tracking application parsed and useable for flash and actionscript. More details to come.
