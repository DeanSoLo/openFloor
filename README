NOTICE:
It is recommended to use the official openFloor 
software repositories, located at http://github.com/vcazan/openFloor

USAGE INFO:
This package consist of two parts.

One piece of software, written in XCODE is responsible for tracking humans that are on the floor. It is located in the openCVBlobTracking folder. The project file is located at: openCVBlobTracking/apps/blobTracking/blobTracking-OSX/blobTracking.xcodeproj This program will spit out x,y coordinates as well as mood and the number of people on the floor. These values will be documented further at a later time.

The second piece of software is written with Processing. This application decodes the values from the tracking software and creates a user interface that can be projected on the floor. 

*NOTES*
-For more information on how to set up this installation just visit http://www.vladcazan.com/projects/openfloor/

-I have a plan on creating this interface work with Flash and Actionscript so that it will be possible to design more dynamic projections.
